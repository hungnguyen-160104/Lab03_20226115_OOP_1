1.Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language? 

Java is strictly pass-by-value. When passing primitives, a copy of the value is passed. For objects, a copy of the reference is passed, meaning the method can modify the object's contents but cannot reassign the original reference. This behavior may seem like pass-by-reference, but technically, it's not.
